# TrPlexy
Transmission Interface for Linux (working great with Plex !)


# Easy install:

First, copy the server into any working nodejs installation and just edit the main.js file with your transmission information !

After that, just go into the web/ folder and execute the build command from angular after editing all "components".ts file with your nodejs server (created in before), after that just run the angular build command "ng build"
